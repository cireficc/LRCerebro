# DO NOT MODIFY THIS FILE MANUALLY!
#
# This file holds configuration variables for the live site (Cerebro)
# /settings loads these variables and overwrites them if they are changed
# via the web interface. This file should *only* be modified via that
# interface. If it is your desire to modify this file, log into Cerebro,
# navigate to /settings and update the values there. Doing otherwise would
# risk rendering the file syntactically invalid, causing Cerebro to figuratively
# explode.
